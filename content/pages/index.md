This is an experiment in self publishing.

Table of Contents:
[Ownership](/ownership) | [Facebook](/facebook)

Goals:

- Permanence - The core content of this project is formatted to be highly intelligible, permanent, and portable. Markdown is the language used to write the content, which is then transformed appropriately to the target platform.
- Persuasion - The writings here are pitched to serve others and be persuasive. There will be no self-serving content or manifestos that are not intended to be read by a general audience.
- Independence - Whichever platform currently hosts this collection, it will be highly distributed and independent of any centralized infrastructure. It will depend upon providers to the smallest degree which is feasible.
- Simple - Whichever tooling is needed to meet the above goals will change often. The primary operating mode should be as simple and inert as possible. The tools which transform the source content to the target medium should also be simple and reliable, so as to encourage continuing use and maintainability.

I strive to be an example for those that come after me.

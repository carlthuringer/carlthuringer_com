- When a person is motivated to do a bad thing, telling them not to is generally ineffective.
- Is that thing they're doing bad, or is it just something you don't like?
- Bad things worth stopping are those that harm other people.
- If someone is being harmed, it is their responsibility to report the harm to society and bring the bad-doer to justice.

# Solidarity

(What is solidarity? Maybe I need to research it in anarchist writings...)

Unity is Strength. Unity of purpose, objective, goal. Unity in maximizing the health and liberty of humanity. This is Solidarity. Its opposite is Divisiveness. Discord and suspicion, demonization and othering, destruction and oppression. Those that are not us will be destroyed. 

When we are unified, we trust one another's goals to be noble. We are willing to engage with ideas different from our own and to find common ground. In solidarity we are less fearful that an opposing group will defeat and destroy us, especially from within.

We base our notion of Solidarity on simple, fundamental truths of humanity. The natural gifts all men and women possess at birth; A body able to wander great distances in search of comfort and comradery. Hands that can shape and work the Earth into great and productive new forms. A mind that can wander and shape beyond our mortal bounds, into the mysteries of the universe. These three gifts are cherished and nurtured, and it is unjust to place bounds upon them.

We also respect nature and what the Earth provides. We do not despoil her or imbalance her cycles. What we make, we make as a gift to the Earth as well as a gift for ourselves. If it cannot be given back to the Earth, then we unmake it when we are done. When someday we leave the Earth, our new vessel too we will cherish with the lessons learned from our mother planet.

## Opponents of Solidarity

The opponents of Solidarity say that no, we must place bounds on people, for what chaos will emerge if people wantonly use their hands to harm others, and break their works. What if people use their minds to concoct and spread insidious ideas? What if people all come to me, and smother me by their free movement?

To respond to this first we have to dispel the darkness feeding these thoughts with a simple word. Why? Yes, why is it that a woman would come upon another and beat or wound her? Why would a man spread insidious ideas? Why would a crowd charge forth and fill occupied spaces beyond capacity?

All of these things spark a certain revulsion in the heart. The natural reaction is to shun, to cast away, and pray against their coming. But this reaction is the very root of Division, and we must rise above and beyond it to achieve Solidarity. 

What, then, is the common root of this revulsion? These acts are evil, one says. What does that mean, Evil? Excuse me for appealing to semantics, but this is very important to the argument that some acts inspire revulsion whilst others take hardly any note. When a woman gives an apple to another, we think of it as a good act. But if she strikes the other, we think it is a bad act. Here we have a good starting point. To act helpfully is good, whilst acting harmfully is bad. So the one acting harmfully is acting in Evil. Perhaps.

Now consider two men striking one another, pausing, then resuming their fight. Clearly this is harm upon harm, and both are acting in Evil. Not so, they are practicing a martial art and teaching one another. What appears harmful to the lay person is clearly measured and balanced to do no permanent damage when examined by the artist. So there are some acts which, when judged by a lay person appear evil, but when judged by the artist, appear good. 

Because of this it seems that it is not sufficient to simply judge acts in isolation. Further, the judge needs to know the terms of art relevant to the act being judged, or have them explained by a witness who does know such terms. It becomes rather complicated in this way, so let us try another tactic.

## Consent, Good, and Evil
Again consider the martial arts practice. If we encounter this and observe the participants, and become alarmed, we may cry out, "Hey, stop that!" though we may not know to whom we are crying to stop. The participants pause and address you, "No need, we are practicing martial arts." You are satisfied and your perspective changes. Though you may not understand the martial art being practiced, you no longer see it as an evil act, not in this circumstance. Why is that?

It is because the practicioners, having stopped their practice to explain to the interloper that they are not in any danger, have signaled in the subtext that their exchange of blows is consensual. In the same way you feel that one attack is revolting, this feeling becomes absent. The revulsion stems from the natural opposition to a breach of consent.

Therefore we can say that evil acts are those inflicted without consent of the receiver, and good acts are consensual. Let us take the nature of consent as a given for this discussion. It is understood by all parties what constitutes consent.

What, then of the woman giving the apple? Are we to assume that consent was granted by the receiver, or is it unimportant when the act is helpful? It seems it might still be annoying to a person who is not hungry to receive apples from strangers, but if she is not burdened by the apple, or can easily return it, then it seems there was little harm. Naturally in examining the case we come back to the concept of harm, which again I take for granted, and which necessarily emerged when we attempted to identify how an act beneficial in intention could be harmful in receipt.

For example, what if the apple were thrown? Depending on the consent of the receiver, this could be a delightful game, or a shocking assault. What if the woman graciously gives her friend twenty bushels of apples, and then flees the scene. Now our recipient is reponsible party to twenty bushels of apples which she did not consent to be responsible for, and her time will be taken up by the disposal thereof. Again we see there are measures of help and harm, consent and non-consent. A spectrum of good and evil forms, some more so, some less so. The final answer seems to be that at the one end, a harmful, non-consensual action is the most evil, whereas a helpful, consensual action is the least evil. And somewhere in between lie helpful non-consensual and harmful consensual acts.

If a boy asks another boy to poke him with a pin, just to see what it feels like, was the act evil, or good? There's no end to the ambiguity.

( Hmmm... something something therefore consent is the more important dimension. Like assisted suicides. )

## Evil Acts, Evil People?

Our tools are as follows: Evil acts are harmful acts 


We do not need to be of a single mind to practice Solidarity, nor agree on every political philosphy. Solidarity runs beneath specific concerns and embodies the desire of humanity to be eternal and thriving. Those that support this purpose can discuss their differences and find common purpose. We can agree to live differently while supporting one another's right to live freely.

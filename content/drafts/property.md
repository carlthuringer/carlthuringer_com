# Private Property

The right to private property is at the root of all struggle in civil society. It provides security and power to those that hold it, and through its power, furthers the acquisition of more private property. All property is held by threat of violence, and too it is relieved by violence. Criminals disrespect the system of private property, but they cannot disrespect the violence which enforces it, and so they confiscate by violence the property of others.

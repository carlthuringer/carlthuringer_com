# Immigration

Immigration is experienced objectively by the resident population when another population migrates into their territory. Let us discuss what this means for both parties.

## Migration

It is a person's free right to migrate. From one field to the next, from one coast to the other, from one hemisphere to the opposite, and even to other planets entirely. To tell a man that he cannot walk from one field to the next is tyranny. To do so when the man flees a wild beast, a wild fire, or other wild men is doubly tyrannical.

But let it be simply that it is a natural right of women and men to walk unbounded. To confine a person to the exact point of their birth is to completely annihilate their fundamental humantiy. Newly born humans struggle daily to improve their mobility and once they attain it, they accelerate. 

As good parents we rule over them and place boundaries on their movement, to protect them where their wisdom yet lacks a healthy alertness to danger in the world. This is our right, and responsibility. We allow these boundaries to ever expand as our children mature, and we pass the responsibilities of life onto them, until at last they leave our care and go out into the world under their own power.

Out there, still, our government acts as a new parent, having established perimeters around our movement in the form of civil law. At first these perimeters may not even be noticeable to the young woman. But as we explore the fullness of the world and our freedom within it, we will press up against those barriers. Restricted areas, prescriptive areas, and national borders.

The restricted areas are much like father's workshop. Full of dangerous material that could easily harm the unwise. But benificence isn't the primary reason for restricting an area. Selfishness, covetousness, and fear also drive restriction. There are very few restricted areas that are justly so, but many which are so restricted because of the fear that someone will enter with evil intent and steal or harm the things or people inside. It is taken for granted that anyone has the right to restrict their property without justification.

## Unjustly Restricted Areas

Assume the owner of a large property has posted "No Trespassing" signs upon her property. The property is in a rural area, and it is some tens of acres through which passes a large stream, spanned by a bridge. Animals migrate in and out of the property, but they are permitted to do so because they cannot understand the meaning of a restricted area.

A man travels down the stream on a canoe. There are "No Trespassing" signs posted on either side of the stream, and one standing in the middle on a pole. They are written in all languages and warn that all trespassers will be shot. The man proceeds and the owner walks out onto the bridge, raises a rifle, and shoots him. Why not? He violated the restricted area, presumably understood the sign, which is written in all languages and clearly said that the consequences of trespassing are death. 

However this killing is a one-sided harm. Had the trespass continued silently along the stream through the property no harm would have come to the owner. Plenty of sticks and fish pass the stream every day without harming the owner, but the trespasser was terminally harmed by the owner's retaliation. If the man in the canoe were a good man with no ill will, and if the owner has been in her home and not known of him, then there would have been no impact on the experience of either party. Killings without harm to the defendant or credible threat of harm are unjustified. The signs are not justification for murder, and merely passing a property line marked as a restricted area is no justification either.

Now it was suggested that if the man were to inflict some harm, that it may be that a defensive killing would be justified. Given the impossibility of reversing a killing, the harm inflicted should be of an equal measure to justify the use of lethal force in preventing the harm. If the man gets out of his canoe carrying a gallon of gasoline and a fistful of matches, opens the gasoline and begins spreading it about as to initiate a wildfire one could imagine the potential damage of that harm as being quite heavily weighted on the scale of justice counted in defense of the killing of the arsonist.

The other end of this spectrum would be to imagine that the man disembarked his canoe, made a camp, and littered the area of the property around his campsite with debris. The harm inflicted by the littering is notable, but not difficult to remediate. If the man cannot be compelled to clean it up, the owner can do so without suffering too greatly, and that may be the end of it. 

But what if the man keeps his campsite and stays there for a year. The owner cannot evict him, and is under constant small harm from his occupation of her property. She is deprived the use of his campsite, must clean the litter, and tolerate the noise. Or must she? Given the man's disregard for the property of others, why not return the harm by moving into his tent, eating his food, and using his water canteen? Well, if she liked the man then she could be his wife. But if she did not like him, and he did not want to share, then at some point force would be applied to prevent usage of one or the other's property, which is the foundation of property right.

(( At this point I think I've gone way off into the weeds... I need to get back around to the thesis somehow. ))

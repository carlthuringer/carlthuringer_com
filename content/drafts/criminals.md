- What is a criminal?

# Criminals

In all civil society there emerges a group of people who disrespect the rules of that society and seek to gain advantage over others through that disrespect. Their conduct is called criminal, and the civil society seeks to punish or expel such persons as they are disruptive not just to the conduct of civil persons, but to the entire edifice of the civilization which calls them such.

The motivation for criminal behavior is simple. Begin with a person in civil society who sees themselves as being at a disadvantage. Their mental self-image is not aligned with their reality, and they blame the civil society for the disparity. Therefore they begin to disrespect the rules of the society because those rules are seen as granting advantage to others, and disadvantage to the malcontent.

It does not matter whether this malcontent is themselves to blame for their disadvantaged condition or distorted self-image. The sociopath, by mental illness, sees others as mere hunks of clay to be manipulated, pushed aside, trodden or preyed upon according to their goals. The drop-out imagines themselves uniquely talented, worthy, and deserving of success and wealth, and so scorned the hard work of school and tradecraft, instead choosing to wait for others to recognize their giftedness and reward them. The buggy-whip maker dreams only of buggy-whips, their form and qualities, and of being world-renowned for their industriousness, vision, and of course their buggy-whips, even though society has long since forgotten the need for them.

The malcontent fester and grumble, are prone to disagreement or disparagement of those they see as successful, and in so doing they fall away from people content with their position, and into circles of other malcontents. This migration isn't strictly necessary for one to be criminal; but it does accelerate the transformation as disparagement of the civil society and the ideas of rebellion evolve faster when there is a marketplace of receptive minds willing to accept and develop them.

The point of criminality is not an action, but a decision that reconciliation of the self-image with the civil society is impossible for the malcontent. With this conviction, the malcontent rejects the civil society and its rules, and they fall into the Law of Nature, where strength and cunning choose the victors and victims. This transformation, too, is aided by the gathering of malcontents and those who have already transformed.

## The terrifying Law of Nature

The border between civil society and the law of nature is a frightening one, because even when the malcontent has completely disengaged from society they still benefit from its protection. Police, hospitals, ambulance drivers and soup kitches will still serve them. But the Law of Nature has no such things. It is the world in which one human kills another human over choice of best mate. Where violence and cunning grant success, rather than trade, social mores...
[hmmmm]

The malcontent is almost certainly not well suited to this Law of Nature, as few are. Many will shy from touching that realm alone, because they will realize its brutality is likely to destroy them. There is, however, comfort in numbers, and when other criminals can testify to survival in the new world, the malcontents' confidence in their conviction grows and faciliates the transformation.

## Criminal Society

Therefore it is the case that most new criminals find they pass through the realm of Nature into a Criminal Society. This society is opposed to the one which they hate, and so they are disposed to appreciate it from the beginning, though it is similar. Criminal Societies too have laws, ethics, and norms, and none of those is likely to be perfectly suited to the newborn criminal. Unfortunatley for the criminal, they also have violence and violent coercion in spades. Whereas in the Civil Society, the criminal was able to mope about, malcontent and disengaged from productive conduct, and the penalties, though harsh, were not critical. Insecurity, poor shelter, poor nutrition, the slow death of apathy.

In the Criminal society, malcontentment and disengagement is violently opposed. By no means will the Criminal Society allow a newborn criminal to cross back over into Civil Society without first facing the true test of Nature. If you aren't with us, then die. All societies thrive on population, and Criminal ones are no exception. Further, the Criminal society is critically threatened by exposure to the Civil Society, and any criminal who crosses back over increases that threat. This is the origin of the first law of Criminal Society: No Snitching.

## The Laws of Criminal Society

Civil and Criminal societies exist as light and shadow, and the Criminal society will always exist. Though the Civil will try to expose and drive away the Criminal society, the shadows move elsewhere. This, however, is of little comfort to the criminals blinded and burned by the light, and so the first law of Criminal Society is the ultimate protection against exposure.

[Why Is Violence prevolent in criminal societies?]

Secondly because violence is prevalent in criminal society, it must be controlled to minimize structural upheaval in the criminal society. Therefore the second law is that one always respects the heirarchy. After one has, through violence, placed themself above all others, they are the absolute ruler. By decree, or further violence, others organize themselves similarly below the ruler, and with this order violence within criminal societies is minimized.
